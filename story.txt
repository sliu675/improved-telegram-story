Telegrams were used to send messages over long distances using symbols and codes. They were invented in the late 1700s. Initially the signalling code used to write telegrams was Morse code and as more and more people started using the telegram, they invented systems such as teleprinters and punched tape transmission. Eventually, new codes for writing telegrams came about as well, such as the Baudot code. Eventually the invention of telephones and then the internet made the telegram obsolete. 

The telegram was invented by Samuel Morse, and was in some ways, the first system of texting. Essentially, it worked by pushing electric signals through a wire. This wire was between stations amongst which the communication was to occur.
